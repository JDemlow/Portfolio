          <h3>HTML + CSS + JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            My goal with any project is to use semantic HTML to add meaning and
            accessibility to your site. I am able to create beautiful and
            vibrant web pages by using CSS frameworks such as Tailwind,
            Bootstrap, and CSS pre-processors such as Sass. JavaScript then
            comes in to create an interactive and engaging experience for your
            site users. This trifecta is the core of any great website for
            businesses, and the foundation for how your users experience your
            presence on the web.

          <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
          <p>
            Modern web design should be completely responsive. That is to say
            that your site will appear fantastic on desktop, tablet, mobile, or
            any other screen you can think of. By incorporating Flexbox and Grid
            as part of your site creation, you can be sure that users everywhere
            and at every screen size will have the experience you want and see
            everything you have to offer them.

          <h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>
          <p>
            It's always a major priority of mine that users are able to find
            your site quickly and easily. SEO is a critical part of any site,
            and yours should be no exception. Making sure your site loads
            quickly, is responsive on all devices, adding meta tags, controlling
            image size, and so much more goes into making your site show up when
            users search for you. I will always make sure your site is optimized
            prior to delivery.

      <div class="about-me__body">
        <p>
          I'm a front-end web developer who has freelanced in Colorado and
          helped my clients create a fantastic presence online, allowing them to
          be discovered by new customers, and helping them grow their businesses
          by increasing who can see them on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my work as a software engineer, I have played the drums
          professionally for over 15 years and taught privately for over 12. I'm
          passionate about learning foreign languages such as Spanish and
          French, as well as spending time learning chess theory. I love the
          outdoors and I love meetups where I can connect with new people and
          get to know them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are looking for someone who can make your ideas come to life on
          the web, then look no further.

          “James was incredible to work with. The main things I look for a in a
          partnership because quality work are communication and timeliness and
          James provided all of it. It was not only a pleasure to work with him
          but he also provided tons of education on next steps and different
          routes we could take. I will be using him in the future and would
          recommend him to anyone else”

          "James audited our website and discovered some major issues that we
          had overlooked. He was thorough in his explanation, and described how
          the issues that he found would affect our SEO, and gave us some clear
          suggestions on how to remedy them. Since taking his advice I was able
          to get another page indexed by Google that I had been having trouble
          with for months, and a number of our pages went up significantly in
          search rankings.”
